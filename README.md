# CSC8503

This project requires the use of third party software, CMake, in order to compile. 
If you are having trouble getting the game to run yourself, please refer to the linked video on my portfolio to see the game running.


In single player, your goal is to destroy all red destructible objects withint the time limit. Use WASD to move and Q/E to rotate.
Left click to headbutt nearby objects and send them flying. Destructible objects are destroyed when headbutted or hit by projectiles.
The player can also pickup blue collectibles for extra points.
